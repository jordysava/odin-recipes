        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe was passed to me by a friend whose husband loved Buffalo wings and baked potatoes.
             I made it for the first time for my crew of boys and it was a big hit. Being a single working mom and short on time, 
             I made some shortcuts to the recipe and to my surprise, 
            it tasted even better.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons hot pepper sauce</li>
            <li>â…“ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>8 potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
            </li>                       
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Heat hot pepper sauce, olive oil, garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, and salt in a large skillet over low heat, stirring until thoroughly combined. Turn off heat. Toss potatoes in batches with the hot pepper sauce mixture to coat and use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to the prepared baking dish. Leave remaining sauce in skillet. Mix chicken into remaining sauce and allow to marinate while potatoes roast.</li>
            <li>Bake potatoes until tender inside and crisp and brown outside, 45 to 50 minutes, stirring every 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce oven heat to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spread chicken cubes over roasted potatoes. Sprinkle Mexican cheese blend, cooked bacon, and green onions over chicken</li>
            <li>Bake in oven until chicken is cooked through and the cheese topping is bubbling, about 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
